### Hello There

I'm embarassed to admit it, but it appears that I'm writing a blog. 

I don't like the urge for a publicized life. I understand that external gratification (such as would come from an audience) is fleeting
and cannot sustain you as well as validation from within. But here I am. I guess that I enjoy creating things that other people like, and I've
found that writing is the easiest way for me to do that. Therefore, I hope you find something that gives you joy or peace. Even better, I
wish you love and happiness.
