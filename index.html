		<h1>01/2023 - Hello there</h1>

		<p>
		I don't like the urge for a publicized life. I understand that <br>
		external gratification (such as would come from an audience) is <br>
		fleeting and cannot sustain you as well as validation from within.<br>
		But here I am. I guess that I enjoy creating things that other <br> 
		people like, and I've found that writing is the easiest way for <br>
		me to do that. Therefore, I hope you find something here that <br>
		gives you joy or peace. Even better, I wish you love and happiness.

		<h3>January 29th</h3>

		<p>
		I've been trying to be more positive recently.
		</p>

		<p>
		It's true that I've got a couple things to be displeased with. For<br>
		example, I'm having a bit of job trouble. Been having, actually,<br>
		for a little while. Since June. Though my job search has been <br>
		admittedly on-and-off, I was not expecting it to take this long. 
		</p>

		<p>
		I do have a job currently. I'm able to pay bills and I'm only a <br>
		leech on my parents in terms of insurance and phone plan. I just <br>
		wish that I were moving forward in my life instead of being stuck <br>
		in this limbo between school and work. I'm not getting many projects <br>
		done. I'm not very motivated.<br>
		And it's fucking frigid outside.
		</p>

		<p>
		*Author's note: I don't swear while speaking. Pretty much ever.<br>
		I try to avoid it in formal writing as well. I've always had the <br>
		philosophy that there's a better word out there than whatever four-<br>
		letter one comes to mind first. Here, though, I think I want to <br>
		relax that rule of mine. After all, this is an informal blog. <br>
		And I can do whatever the hell I want. 
		</p>

		<p>
		With all that said, things are going very well. I have a supportive <br>
		partner and friends, I'm in good health. Overall I've got nothing <br> 
		to really moan about, and all that moaning I'm doing anyways is <br>
		taking up my valuable time. It's probably annoying the neighbors<br>
		as well. 
		</p>

		<p>
		So I'm switching things up. I started a playlist with more <br> 
		positive music. I set up the downtime feature on my phone to keep <br>
		me focused. Instead of sitting at my desk at home, tapping away at <br>
		my computer like a gremlin, I went out to a coffee shop and tapped <br>
		away at my computer like a gremlin. I started a blog. 
		</p>

		<p>
		Spring is soon, and change is in the air - I can feel it. 
		</p>
