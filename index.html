		<h1>01/2023 - Hello there</h1>

		<p>
		I don't like the urge for a publicized life. I understand that 
		external gratification (such as would come from an audience) is 
		fleeting and cannot sustain you as well as validation from within.
		But here I am. I guess that I enjoy creating things that other  
		people like, and I've found that writing is the easiest way for 
		me to do that. Therefore, I hope you find something here that 
		gives you joy or peace. Even better, I wish you love and happiness.

		<h3>January 29th</h3>

		<p>
		I've been trying to be more positive recently.
		</p>

		<p>
		It's true that I've got a couple things to be displeased with. For
		example, I'm having a bit of job trouble. Been having, actually,
		for a little while. Since June. Though my job search has been 
		admittedly on-and-off, I was not expecting it to take this long. 
		</p>

		<p>
		I do have a job currently. I'm able to pay bills and I'm only a 
		leech on my parents in terms of insurance and phone plan. I just 
		wish that I were moving forward in my life instead of being stuck 
		in this limbo between school and work. I'm not getting many projects 
		done. I'm not very motivated. <br>
		And it's fucking frigid outside.
		</p>

		<p>
		*Author's note: I don't swear while speaking. Pretty much ever.
		I try to avoid it in formal writing as well. I've always had the 
		philosophy that there's a better word out there than whatever four-
		letter one comes to mind first. Here, though, I think I want to 
		relax that rule of mine. After all, this is an informal blog. 
		And I can do whatever the hell I want. 
		</p>

		<p>
		With all that said, things are going very well. I have a supportive 
		partner and friends, I'm in good health. Overall I've got nothing  
		to really moan about, and all that moaning I'm doing anyways is 
		taking up my valuable time. It's probably annoying the neighbors
		as well. 
		</p>

		<p>
		So I'm switching things up. I started a playlist with more  
		positive music. I set up the downtime feature on my phone to keep 
		me focused. Instead of sitting at my desk at home, tapping away at 
		my computer like a gremlin, I went out to a coffee shop and tapped 
		away at my computer like a gremlin. I started a blog. 
		</p>

		<p>
		Spring is soon, and change is in the air - I can feel it. 
		</p>

		<h3>Cigarette</h3>

		<p>
		I sit here with my cigarette<br>
		(it is actually a stick of string cheese)<br>
		That I clasp between two fingers.
		</p>

		<p>
		I am preparing to write a letter<br>
		probably long and winding<br>
		To someone whom I used to know quite well<br>
		and who changed my life<br>
		(not necessarily for the better).
		</p>

		<p>
		How will she receive it?
		</p>

		<p>
		No matter what, I am here,<br>
		Cigarette between my lips,<br>
		In an attempt to understand. 
		</p>

		<p>
		Do you let the past lie?<br>
		Or do you want to check back in,<br>
		And see how it's doing?
		</p>

		<p>
		I would imagine that I changed her life as well,<br>
		though I can't be certain.
		</p>
		
		<p>
		I think it's good to tread the banks forgotten,<br>
		left behind in fog, but need recalling<br>
		If only just to give them thanks<br>
		For what I now have come to be.<br>
		So bum a cigarette my friend,<br>
		and stroll with me through memory. 
		</p>
