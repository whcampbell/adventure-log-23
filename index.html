		<h1>01/2023 - Hello there</h1>

		<p>
		I don't like the urge for a publicized life. I understand that external gratification 
		(such as would come from an audience) is fleeting and cannot sustain you as well as 
		validation from within. But here I am. I guess that I enjoy creating things that other 
		people like, and I've found that writing is the easiest way for me to do that. 
		Therefore, I hope you find something here that gives you joy or peace. Even better, 
		I wish you love and happiness.
		</p>

		<h3>January 29th</h3>

		<p>
		I've been trying to be more positive recently.<br>
		It's true that I've got a couple things to be displeased with. For example, I'm having a
		bit of job trouble. Been having, actually, for a little while. 
		</p>
		<p>
		That said, things are going very well. I've got nothing to really moan about, and all that
		moaning I'm doing anyways is taking up my valuable time. It's probably annoying the neighbors as well.
