		<h1 id="name">01/2023 - Hello there</h1>

		<p>
		I don't like the urge for a publicized life. I understand that 
		external gratification (such as would come from an audience) is 
		fleeting and cannot sustain you as well as validation from within.
		But here I am. I guess that I enjoy creating things that other  
		people like, and I've found that writing is the easiest way for 
		me to do that. Therefore, I hope you find something here that 
		gives you joy or peace. Even better, I wish you love and happiness.

				I've been trying to be more positive recently.
				</p>

				<p>
				It's true that I've got a couple things to be displeased with. For
				example, I'm having a bit of job trouble. Been having, actually,
				for a little while. Since June. Though my job search has been 
				admittedly on-and-off, I was not expecting it to take this long. 
				</p>

				<p>
				I do have a job currently. I'm able to pay bills and I'm only a 
				leech on my parents in terms of insurance and phone plan. I just 
				wish that I were moving forward in my life instead of being stuck 
				in this limbo between school and work. I'm not getting many projects 
				done. I'm not very motivated. <br>
				And it's fucking frigid outside.
				</p>

				<p>
				*Author's note: I don't swear while speaking. Pretty much ever.
				I try to avoid it in formal writing as well. I've always had the 
				philosophy that there's a better word out there than whatever four-
				letter one comes to mind first. Here, though, I think I want to 
				relax that rule of mine. After all, this is an informal blog. 
				And I can do whatever the hell I want. 
				</p>

				<p>
				With all that said, things are going very well. I have a supportive 
				partner and friends, I'm in good health. Overall I've got nothing  
				to really moan about, and all that moaning I'm doing anyways is 
				taking up my valuable time. It's probably annoying the neighbors
				as well. 
				</p>

				<p>
				So I'm switching things up. I started a playlist with more  
				positive music. I set up the downtime feature on my phone to keep 
				me focused. Instead of sitting at my desk at home, tapping away at 
				my computer like a gremlin, I went out to a coffee shop and tapped 
				away at my computer like a gremlin. I started a blog. 
				</p>

				<p>
				Spring is soon, and change is in the air - I can feel it.

				<p>
				I sit here with my cigarette<br>
				(it is actually a stick of string cheese)<br>
				That I clasp between two fingers.
				</p>

				<p>
				I am preparing to write a letter<br>
				probably long and winding<br>
				To someone whom I used to know quite well<br>
				and who changed my life<br>
				(not necessarily for the better).
				</p>

				<p>
				How will she receive it?
				</p>

				<p>
				No matter what, I am here,<br>
				Cigarette between my lips,<br>
				In an attempt to understand. 
				</p>

				<p>
				Do you let the past lie?<br>
				Or do you want to check back in,<br>
				And see how it's doing?
				</p>

				<p>
				I would imagine that I changed her life as well,<br>
				though I can't be certain.
				Was it for the better?

				I've been a bit more productive. I think. 
				</p>

				<p>
				It's possible that I've just shifted towards being productive
				in other fields. I mean, I've been much LESS productive in 
				applying for jobs. But I have a reason for that. 
				</p>

				<p>
				Someone from a recruiting agency reached out to me a little while ago. 
				They were looking for a candidate for a client. It turned out that
				I wasn't the right fit, but they wanted to talk to me a little more. 
				I asked why employers were so unresponsive. She basically said that
				an application through Indeed (or the like) is a needle in a haystack.
				</p>

				<p>
				This did not bolster my confidence in my past fifty applications 
				through Indeed. 
				</p>

				<p>
				In honesty, I've just been waiting. Waiting for that recruiter to bring
				me some good news. Waiting to hear back on a recent interview. My 
				hope in other areas is drowned out by those prospects. I should do more
				portfolio work in the meantime. I'll add it to the stack. 
				</p>

				<p>
				Outside of the dreary job world, though, I have been able to get some
				things done. I drew up my first comic (nothing to write home about,
				but I think it's a little funny). I've been consistent with writing
				for my DnD campaigns. I've been prompt with my letters.
				</p>

				<p>
				Looking forward to when its warm again, so I can bike around the city.
